# The Slack Seas Blog

> *"Documenting the journey, one project at a time."*

This repository houses the source code for the Slack Seas project journaling blog, built with **Jekyll**, inside a **Docker devcontainer**.

## üí° About This Blog

This space serves as a public journal for my personal development and coding projects. The goal is to:

1.  **Document the Process:** Track the challenges, decisions, and successes of each project from start to finish.
2.  **Solidify Learning:** Writing about a concept is the best way to ensure I truly understand it.
3.  **Share the Journey:** Provide transparency and insights for others who might be working on similar projects.

## üöÄ Getting Started (Local Setup)

This project is configured to run instantly using **Visual Studio Code Dev Containers**. This is the recommended way to get started, as it ensures all necessary **Ruby** and **Jekyll** dependencies are installed and configured correctly.

### 1. Recommended: Use Dev Containers üê≥

1.  **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed and running, and the [Remote - Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) in VS Code.
2.  **Open in Container:** When you open this repository in VS Code, you'll see a prompt asking to **"Reopen in Container"**. Click it.
3.  **Start Jekyll:** Once the container is built and running, open the integrated terminal and run the following command to serve the blog:
    ```bash
    bundle exec jekyll serve --host 0.0.0.0
    ```
    Your blog will be available at `http://localhost:4000`.

### 2. Manual Setup (Alternative)

If you prefer to run the blog directly on your machine, you'll need to have **Ruby**, **RubyGems**, and **Jekyll** installed manually.

* **Prerequisites:** You need Ruby and Bundler (`gem install bundler`).
* **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    bundle install
    ```
* **Run Locally:**
    ```bash
    bundle exec jekyll serve
    ```

## ‚úçÔ∏è Content and Contribution

Since this is a personal journaling blog, I won't be accepting outside content contributions. However, I always appreciate feedback or discussions on the projects!

### Content Structure

All blog posts are written in **Markdown** and follow the standard Jekyll naming convention:

* Posts are located in the `_posts` directory.
* The file naming format is `YYYY-MM-DD-post-title.md`.

Each post must begin with **YAML front matter** to define metadata (title, date, tags, etc.).
